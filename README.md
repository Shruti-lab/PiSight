  <p>Wearable and Voice-Controlled Assistive Glasses, designed to support individuals with visual impairments</p>

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**

Millions of individuals with visual impairments face challenges in navigating their surroundings, recognizing obstacles, reading text, and responding to emergencies independently. Existing assistive technologies are often bulky, expensive, or lack real-time feedback and intelligent interaction. There is a need for an affordable, lightweight, and intelligent wearable solution that can **capture the environment, interpret visual data, detect hazards, and respond to voice commands** — all in real-time, without relying on internet connectivity. And that is exactly what we are implementing through PiSIGHT!

## 🌟 **Key Features of our Solution**

- 👁️ **Live Environment Capture:** Real-time video feed from Raspberry Pi 4 camera mounted on wearable glasses, adding portability to our solution.
- 📖 **Text-to-Speech OCR:** Converts captured text (like signs, menus, labels) into speech using Optical Character Recognition, transmitted via bluetooth.
- 🧭 **Surrounding Object Detection:** Detects nearby objects (like people, vehicles, furniture) and announces their position and distance.
- 🚨 **Emergency Mode:** Automatically triggers alerts and alarms if weapons or threats are detected in the vicinity. In case of threat activity, a message alert will be sent to the user's emergency contact through a mobile app.
- 🎙️ **Voice-Activated Commands:** Users can activate navigation, read text, or trigger emergency modes using simple voice commands.
